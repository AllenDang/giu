## Features

Compare to other imgui golang bindings, giu has following features:

- Live-update during the resizing of OS window.
- Redraw only when user event occurred. Costs only 0.5% CPU usage with 60FPS.
- Declarative UI (WIP).

Still in early state, welcome to have a try and feedback your feelings.
